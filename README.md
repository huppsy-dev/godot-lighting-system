# Godot Lighting System
- Simple lighting system for Godot engine 2D games, works best with top-down movement games but can be tweaked to work on any 2D game (eg. platformer game) 
- Can be tweaked to work with 3D games although i DO NOT recommend it because it is made ONLY for 2D games, but if you are a techie person you can do it! I believe in you :))
### Remember that this IS NOT a shader, thus every setting needs to be made manually using code or the godot node editor
> I recommend you to use the godot node editor (it is much easier than using script)
